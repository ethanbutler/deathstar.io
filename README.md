# deathstar.io

This is just a quick demo I'm putting together to demonstrate a few concepts involving `xstate`  for my team at work:

- Using `xstate` as a replacement for app logic
- Using model-based testing for testing apps written both with and without state machines, using `@testing-library` and `msw`

It's a simple app that involves role-playing as the Death Star. You have the option to destroy planets, fetched via [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/). Of course, if you try to blow up Alderaan, the rebel forces will find your weak spot and blow _you_ up.

## Setup

This is just a `create-react-app` project, so you have all the scripts you'd expect there.
